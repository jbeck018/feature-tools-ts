# Interactive Documentation Plan for FeatureTools TypeScript

This document outlines the approach for implementing interactive documentation for the FeatureTools TypeScript library.

## Goals

- Make documentation more engaging and easier to understand
- Allow users to try out the API directly within the documentation
- Provide visual representation of complex relationships and types
- Reduce the learning curve for new users

## Target Audience

- Data scientists transitioning from Python to TypeScript
- Web developers integrating feature engineering into applications
- Open-source contributors to the FeatureTools TypeScript project

## Key Components

### 1. Interactive Code Playground

A browser-based REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) environment where users can:
- Try out FeatureTools TypeScript code directly
- See results immediately
- Experiment with different configurations
- Explore type safety features interactively

### 2. API Explorer

An interactive interface to:
- Browse the available classes, methods, and types
- See relationships between different components
- Search and filter functionality
- Navigate from tutorials to relevant API docs

### 3. Visual Type Diagrams

- Visual representation of type hierarchies
- Interactive diagrams showing relationships between entities
- Flowcharts showing data transformation pipelines
- Expandable/collapsible complex types

### 4. Tutorial Walkthrough System

- Step-by-step walkthroughs with inline code execution
- Interactive challenges/exercises
- Progress tracking
- Sample datasets for experimentation

## Technical Implementation Options

### 1. Code Playground

**Option A: Embedded Sandbox**
- Use [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) or [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/) embeds
- Pro: Full TypeScript environment
- Con: External dependency and potential loading issues

**Option B: Custom REPL**
- Build a custom TypeScript REPL using Monaco Editor and TypeScript compiler
- Pro: Full control over the experience
- Con: More complex to implement and maintain

**Option C: Runnable Code Blocks**
- Enhance markdown code blocks to be executable
- Pro: Integrated with existing documentation
- Con: Limited functionality compared to full sandbox

### 2. API Explorer

**Option A: Docusaurus + TypeDoc Integration**
- Use Docusaurus for documentation with TypeDoc-generated API reference
- Pro: Good integration with existing documentation system
- Con: Limited customization for interactive features

**Option B: Custom React-Based Explorer**
- Build a custom React application for API exploration
- Pro: Full control over UI/UX and interactive features
- Con: Requires separate maintenance from main documentation

**Option C: Enhanced TypeDoc Output**
- Extend TypeDoc with custom plugins for interactive features
- Pro: Builds on existing documentation generation
- Con: Limited by TypeDoc's extension capabilities

### 3. Visual Diagrams

**Option A: Mermaid.js Integration**
- Use Mermaid.js for generating diagrams from code
- Pro: Text-based diagram definitions, good for version control
- Con: Limited interactivity

**Option B: D3.js Custom Visualizations**
- Build custom D3.js visualizations for type relationships
- Pro: Highly customizable and interactive
- Con: Complex implementation

**Option C: React Flow or similar library**
- Use React Flow for interactive node-based diagrams
- Pro: Built-in interactivity, good for relationship visualization
- Con: May require significant data transformation

## Recommended Approach

Based on the project's current state and resources, the following approach is recommended:

1. **Start with Enhanced TypeDoc + Mermaid.js**
   - Leverage existing TypeDoc integration
   - Add Mermaid.js diagrams to visualize relationships
   - Relatively quick implementation

2. **Add Runnable Code Blocks**
   - Implement executable code blocks in documentation
   - Use TypeScript playground API or similar tooling
   - Balance between functionality and implementation effort

3. **Future Enhancement: Custom API Explorer**
   - As a second phase, create a more interactive API explorer
   - Build on top of the enhanced TypeDoc output
   - Add search, filtering, and relationship navigation

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Enhanced Documentation with Diagrams (Current Sprint)

1. Set up Mermaid.js integration with current documentation
2. Create type relationship diagrams for key components
3. Add sequence diagrams for common workflows
4. Implement basic interactivity (expandable sections, tabs)

### Phase 2: Runnable Code Examples (Next Sprint)

1. Research and select a code playground integration approach
2. Implement runnable code blocks in tutorials
3. Create preset examples that demonstrate key features
4. Add the ability to save and share code snippets

### Phase 3: Interactive API Explorer (Future)

1. Design and implement a custom API explorer interface
2. Create visualization of type hierarchies and relationships
3. Implement advanced search and filtering
4. Connect tutorials with relevant API documentation

## Success Metrics

- Reduced time for new users to become productive
- Increased engagement with documentation (time spent, pages viewed)
- Reduced support requests for basic usage questions
- Positive user feedback on documentation quality
- Increased contribution to the project

This plan will be revisited and adjusted based on user feedback and implementation progress.
